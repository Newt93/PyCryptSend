# PyCryptSend
A project I used to learn about how cryptocurrency (eth) is sent to a wallet like Metamask.
This code connects to an Ethereum node running on http://localhost:8545, 
signs a transaction with the private key of your Ethereum account, sends the transaction to the network, and waits for it to be mined. 
You need to replace YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY and YOUR_METAMASK_WALLET_ADDRESS with your private key and the address of the MetaMask wallet you 
want to send Ether to.

Please note that this example is for testing purposes and it should be used with a testnet not with a mainnet, 
also you need to make sure that you are using the correct node endpoint!!!!
